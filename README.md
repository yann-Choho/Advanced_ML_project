### GitHub repository description:

Deep neural networks such as CNN's are sensitive to adversarial attacks, that is they can classify a imperceptably perturbed input differently than the unperturbed one. The questions arose in the articles below are about the exsistence of models robust to such attacks. We would like to encode and train models which can resist different type of attacks such as Fast Gradient Sign Method or Projected Gradient Descent, and then compare our results with "naturally trained" networks. We would also like to test the method on different databases to understand possible empirical limits.
